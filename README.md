## TFDeepSurv
COX Proportional risk model implemented by tensorflow

### Some different to DeepSurv
DeepSurv is a package for Deep COX Proportional risk model, published on Github, our works may differ in:

- Consider ties of death time, which means different loss function.
- Estimator for survival function, three estimating algorithm provided.
- Scientific Hyperparameters method, Bayesian Hyperparameters Optimize for neural network(in plan).

### TODO-list
- try Bayesian Hyperparameters Optimization for DNN.
- Test simulated data and reality data.
- Analyze results of experiments.

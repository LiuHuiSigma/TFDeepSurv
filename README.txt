TFDeepSurv
COX Proportional risk model and survival analysis implemented by tensorflow.

It'is different from DeepSurv
DeepSurv(https://github.com/jaredleekatzman/DeepSurv) is a package for Deep COX Proportional risk model, published on Github. But our works may differ in:

- Evaluate importance of features in neural network.
- Automatic processing ties of death time in you data, which means different loss function and estimator for survival function.
- Estimator for survival function, three estimating algorithm provided.
- Scientific Hyperparameters tuning method, Bayesian Hyperparameters Optimization for neural network.

Statement
The paper about this project will be published in this year. The project is based on
research of Breast Cancer, we will update status here once paper published !

Installation and Usage
see README.md

More properties:

Scientific Hyperparameters tuning method, Bayesian Hyperparameters Optimization for neural network, which is convenient and automated for tuning hyperparameters in neural network.

For more usage of Bayesian Hyperparameters Optimization, you can see BayesianHyperparamOptimization/README.md
